# Class Documentation and Contribution Guide

Throughout the semester, you are encouraged to contribute to this class by improving and expanding the course documentation.
This documentation is a **living resource** collaboratively developed by both the teaching staff and students.

Because this is a new and open-ended capstone course, you'll be creating unique systems and solutions -- often encountering challenges and insights that even the instructors haven't seen before.
Contributing your discoveries helps everyone: your teammates, the teaching staff, and future students who take this class.

## Why Documentation Matters

Teamwork isn't just about dividing tasks -- it's about making sure that valuable lessons and solutions are shared. If you spend significant time solving a problem or setting something up
(e.g., getting the simulator running on Apple Silicon), your findings can save others hours of work.

Good documentation ensures that:
- Your own future self can revisit and recall what you did.
- Your teammates can build on your work more easily.
- The class community benefits from your experience.

Even if others don't need every technical detail, they should be able to understand the high-level interface of your work -- how to use or run your code, what dependencies it has, and what it accomplishes.

## How to Contribute

We maintain all class code documentation on GitHub to keep contributions organized and collaborative.

Although there are many ways to contribute documentation, we prefer the markdown `.md` format because:
- It is lightweight, plain-text format that is easy to edit on any system.
- Naturally renders as web pages on GitHub.
- Supports links, images, and code blocks.
- Enables collaborative edits as things change (or mistakes or ambiguities are found!).

If you need examples of markdown documentation, checkout other markdown files in this repository or [one of the many markdown references on the internet](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Workflow for Contributions

1. **Create a new branch:** Don't edit the `main` documentation branch directly. Create a branch for your changes.
2. **Make your edits:** Add new content or improve existing material.
3. **Submit a Pull Request (PR):** Open a pull request to merge your branch into the `main` documentation branch. A TA or instructor will review your PR, provide feedback or make (minor) edits, and (once approved) merge your eventuallly merge contribution will be merged.

(Please do not push directly to the main branch! All edits should go through a pull request to maintain version control and quality review.)

If you are unfamiliar with the GitHub pull request process, checkout their main PR documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests) and PR collaboration instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

## Examples of Useful Contributions
- Setup guides for specific hardware or operating systems.
- Clarifications of confusing steps in instructions.
- Notes on debugging or troubleshooting errors.
- Improvements to existing examples or figures.
- Summaries of lessons learned from your project work.

## Notes
- If you have trouble accessing the documentation repository or submitting changes, reach out to the teaching staff. Everyone should have access -- if you don't, let us know so we can fix it.
- Thanks for helping improve this course and its documentation for future students!
